# Step 5: Modeling – Part 2: Choosing a Model

After splitting your data into training, validation, and test sets, the next step in the modeling process is **choosing the right machine learning model** for your problem. This is a crucial decision that can significantly impact the performance and practicality of your solution.

## Key Question

> **Which machine learning model should I use for my problem and data?**

## The Three Parts of Modeling

1. **Choosing a model**
2. **Tuning a model**
3. **Comparing models**

## 1. Choosing a Model

### Prebuilt Algorithms

- You don’t need to invent your own algorithms from scratch.
- There are many **prebuilt models** available in popular libraries (like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc.).
- Your main job is to select the model that fits your problem and data type.

### Matching Models to Data

- **Structured data** (tables, rows and columns):
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- **Unstructured data** (images, audio, text):
  - Deep Learning Neural Networks (CNNs for images, RNNs/Transformers for text)
  - Transfer Learning (using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for your task)

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Feature Variables (Inputs):** The columns or aspects of your data used to make predictions (often called `X`).
- **Target Variables (Outputs/Labels):** The value you want to predict (often called `y`).

In code, you’ll commonly see:
```python
model.fit(X, y)
```

## 2. Training the Model

- **Training happens only on the training dataset.**
- The model tries to learn the patterns that map `X` (inputs) to `y` (outputs).
- **Do not let the model see the validation or test sets during training!**

## 3. Practical Tips for Choosing and Training

- **Start Small:**  
  Use a subset of your data (e.g., first 10,000 rows of 100,000) and/or a simple model to quickly test ideas.
- **Experimentation Speed:**  
  Shorter experiments mean you can try more approaches and improve faster.
- **Consider Training Time:**  
  Complex models (like deep neural networks) can take much longer to train than simpler models (like decision trees).
- **Iterative Process:**  
  Machine learning is about trying, failing, learning, and trying again. Not every idea will work—be ready to pivot.

## Example: Heart Disease Prediction

- **Feature Variables (X):** body weight, sex, resting heart rate, chest pain, etc.
- **Target Variable (y):** whether the patient has heart disease (`yes`/`no`).
- **Choosing a model:** For structured data like this, start with decision trees or gradient boosting models.

## Key Takeaways

- **Different models work best for different problems and data types.**
- **Don’t be afraid to experiment.**
- **Start simple and scale up complexity only if needed.**
- **Aim for practical, real-world results—not just theoretical bests.**
