# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks.
## Key Concepts

1. **Learning from Data**

   - Machine learning systems use large amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships.

   - As more data is fed into the system, the model improves its performance over time.

1. **Algorithms**

   - ML uses mathematical models and algorithms to process data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions.

   - Examples include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, etc.

3. **Applications**

   - Common applications include image recognition, speech recognition, spam detection, recommendation systems, fraud detection, etc.
  
## Simple Example

Suppose you want to teach a computer to recognize pictures of cats and dogs:

- **Training Data:** You provide many images labeled as "cat" or "dog".

- **Model Training:** The algorithm analyzes the images and learns features that distinguish cats from dogs.

- **Prediction:** When shown a new image, the model predicts whether it's a cat or a dog based on what it has learned.

## Why is Machine Learning Important?

- It automates tasks that are difficult or impossible to program manually.

- It enables data-driven decision making.

- It powers many modern technologies (search engines, virtual assistants, self-driving cars, etc.).

## Summary

**Machine Learning = Data + Algorithms → Model that can make predictions/decisions**
