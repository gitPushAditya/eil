# Programming Fundamentals 

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions, also called code, are written in a programming language like C++, Python, or Java.

## Compilation and Execution 

When we write a C++ program, the computer does not understand it directly. It needs to be converted into a format that the machine can execute. This process involves compilation and execution.

### Compilation 

Compilation is the process of converting your C++ source code (.cpp file) into machine code (binary format) that the computer can understand.

**Steps in Compilation** 

- Preprocessing - Handles #include, #define, and other directives.
- Compilation - Converts the preprocessed code into assembly language.
- Assembly - Converts the assembly code into machine code(binary code).
- Linking - Links external libraries and creates an executable file(.exe or .out)

### Execution

Execution is the process where the computer runs the compiled program. The CPU reads and executes the machine code step by step, performing the instructions you wrote in C++.

## Setting up an IDE

Visual Studio Code + Compiler(Mingw)

VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Compiler - https://winlibs.com/ 

### To set up compiler

- Download the 7-Zip archive and extract it. 
- Copy the mingw64 folder to C drive.
- Add the mingw64/bin to system path variable.
