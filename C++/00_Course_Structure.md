## Daily Learning Structure

1. **15-30 minutes**: Review previous day's material
2. **45-60 minutes**: Learn new concepts (reading/videos)
3. **30-45 minutes**: Practice coding exercises
4. **15-30 minutes**: Work on your current project

Remember to:
- Code daily to build muscle memory
- Read other people's code regularly
- Participate in programming communities
- Apply what you learn through projects
- Don't rush - understanding fundamentals deeply is more important than moving quickly through topics
