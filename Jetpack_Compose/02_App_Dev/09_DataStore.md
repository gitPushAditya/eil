# DataStore

We will create datastore files in `data/datastore`.

Normally in app, we can use three different datastores. 

- UserPreferences - App Settings based on user preferences. Eg. Notification On/Off, Themes, etc.
- UserData - Data related to user which will be used in app. Eg. UserName etc.
- AppData - Data which is completely managed by app. Eg. SelectedScreen etc.
